Social media has changed the people mindset to express thoughts and moods. As the activity of social media users increases, it does not rule out the possibility of crimes of spreading hate speech can spread quickly and widely. So that it is not possible to detect hate speech manually. GRU is one of the deep learning methods that has the ability to learn information relations from the previous time to the present time. In this research feature extraction used is word2vec, because it has the ability to learn semantics between words. In this research the GRU performance will be compared with other supervision methods such as support vector machine, naive bayes, decision tree and logistic regression. The results obtained show that the best accuracy is 92.96% by the GRU model with word2vec feature extraction. The use of word2vec in the comparison supervision method is not good enough from tf and tf-idf.
